The solution for the task is displayed in the main.ipynb file. For the task, the images and light_directions.txt file are read by using OpenCV. A mask is created and used to compute p and q. q and p are given to the frankotchellappa(p, q) function to calculate.
The notebook can be executed in its entirety without any other interference. Additionally, all results are already provided in the output folder without needing to execute any code. Executing the code will overwrite the files in the output folder.
